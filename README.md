Part of bigger idea whre TCP communication would be defined by config files. Headers defined to checks, and variables following. Messages would be parsed and data extracted as variables. In the end developer would need to worry only about grabing page containing ready data. This was done by me years later in C# where all comminication is dfefined in json files and actual process does not know anything about TCP messages. This also protects code against random messages on the NIC (not in this code... yet...)
